# 4. Digital Signature

## Requirements

â€¢ Develop a dapp to digitally sign a document with a SHA-256 hash algorithm, and verify its authenticity by comparing the hash value at time of check with the value stored on the blockchain.

## Functionality

### UI to upload a document and store it in IPFS.

- Use the Infura API for IPFS: www.infura.io

### Calculate the SHA-256 hash value and store it on the blockchain.

### UI to verify a document:

- Upload a document
- Calculate the hash value
- Compare the hash value with the value stored on the blockchain
- If they match, the document is the same, otherwise shows an error
